## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I used this opportunity to practice my ReactJs knowledge and also CSS Custom-Properties. I managed to do all CSS responsiveness with only CSS Custom Properties and I really liked it. it felt amazing to only change a couple of things and Voila! now it works both in mobile mode and also desktop mode.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

I definitely would want to cut off some of my repeated code and also reach the goal with much fewer lines of code. Maybe I have to try using useRef, but that was not something I intended for this challenge.
